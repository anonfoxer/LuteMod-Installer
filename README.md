# LuteMod-Installer
A less than efficient but hopefully functional installer for Monty's &amp; Dimencia's LuteMod


# How to use
- Download the latest version from the Releases tab.
- Extract this .zip anywhere you like.
- Run `LuteModInstaller.exe`
- If Mordhau is installed at the default Steam location (C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Mordhau\), check "Use default location", decide wether or not you want to ignore the modloader, and click Install.
- If Mordhau is installed ANYWHERE ELSE, Click "Browse", and select the folder that contains your "steamapps" folder. Example, if Mordhau is installed at `F:\Games\steamapps\common\Mordhau\`, select the folder `F:\Games`. Once you've done this, decide wether or not you want to ignore the modloader, and click Install.
